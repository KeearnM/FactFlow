            "summary": "Radio telescopes have observed a magnetar, XTE J1810-197, that is a neutron star with a powerful magnetic field located nearby Earth. The star, previously dormant, is emitting unusual radio pulses that appear to be circularly polarized, which is unprecedented for magnetars. Researchers have suggested that a superheated plasma above the magnetar's magnetic pole is acting as a polarizing filter, but the exact mechanism is yet to be determined. The observations also revealed systematic changes in the magnetar's radio beam orientation, challenging some models used to explain Fast Radio Bursts.",

TSMC will also invest an additional $25bn, bringing its total investment in Arizona to over $65bn. The first two plants' construction is already underway, with production scheduled to start in 2025 and 2028, respectively. The funding will enable TSMC to build a third factory. Once all three factories are operational, they are expected to provide 6,000 direct jobs and additional 20,000 construction jobs.",
