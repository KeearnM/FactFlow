I think it will also be a perfect frame for our art,’ Louise said of the blue.\n\n‘I’m obsessed with this peach colour which changes throughout the day, as I type it looks much paler than it appears in this picture.\n\n‘Gordon says it reminds him of that beautiful light that comes in the window at sunrise and sunset and I think he’s exactly right.",

            "summary": "As the Biden Administration has seemingly accepted the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan, Republican congressional members have had a field day with bashing Biden over the Afghan debacle, including US Rep. Kat Cammack (R-FL), who is going after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for her responsibility in the chaos. Everyone just needs to get to the airport.”\n\nCammack told Fox that it “speaks volumes of not just the administration, and how they handled this utter, total failure, but Democrat leadership in general,” adding that “When the Speaker of the House is saying that ‘Everything should be in a good place, everybody just needs to get to the airport’ it took me about 10 minutes just to get my jaw up off the desk.”\n\n“I couldn’t believe that when we have left Americans behind, when we have one of the worst examples of an American military failure, no contingency plans in place, and the Speaker of the House is saying ‘everything seems fine’ Madam Speaker, you can’t just take an Uber to the airport! Not a casual stroll through the street” stated Rep. Cammack on Rep. Pelosi. \n\nCammack also commented on the mixed messaging over the current status of the region, claiming that some sources are telling people to stay in place while mainstream media has been naive about the threat posed by the Taliban.\n\nCammack reported that her office is working on getting 187 Americans home, and they are just from Florida’s third congressional district alone.\n\nHowever, according to Cammack, the State Department is still telling Americans to go to the airport .”",
